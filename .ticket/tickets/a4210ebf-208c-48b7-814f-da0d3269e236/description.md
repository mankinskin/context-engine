**Scope:** Medium–Large (3 root causes, cross-crate: `context-api`, `context-insert`, `context-read`)
**Crates:** `context-api`, `context-insert`, `context-read`

## Objective

The integration test suite (`tools/context-cli/tests/`) currently reports:

```
test result: FAILED. 44 passed; 9 failed; 22 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

This plan documents the three fix rounds needed to move those numbers to:

```
test result: ok. 55+ passed; 0 failed; 2 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

The two remaining ignored tests (`oracle_aa`, `skill3_exp_m_repeated_char_known_failing`) require
RC-3 (cursor advancement redesign), which is architecturally deeper and carries higher risk. They
are kept ignored after Rounds 1 and 2 until Round 3 is complete.

Each round is self-contained: it has a defined entry point in the codebase, a minimal change set,
and a concrete verification command. Rounds **must be executed in order** because RC-2 may resolve
as a side effect of RC-1, and RC-3 is independent of both.

## Root Cause Summary

### RC-1 — `insert_sequence` Outer Loop Missing

**Location:** `crates/context-api/src/workspace/manager.rs` — `WorkspaceManager::insert_sequence`

**Mechanism:** `insert_sequence` converts the input text to atom tokens and then calls
`insert_next_match([atom₀, atom₁, …, atomₙ])` **once**. On a fresh graph the first call
returns `InsertOutcome::NoExpansion` for `atom₀` (the first character) — meaning "matched
one atom, cursor can advance; the query extends further." Because `insert_sequence` does not
loop, it returns the first atom as the root token with `already_existed=true` and `width=1`
for **every** multi-character string.

**Impact:** 5 direct test failures + 20 ignored tests blocked (9 `skill3_exp_*`, 11 `oracle_*`).
Also manifests as `file_read_basic` returning "helo wrd" instead of "hello world" because the
`ReadFile` → `read_sequence` path shares the same missing accumulation loop.

**Fix:** Add an outer accumulation loop to `insert_sequence` that repeatedly calls
`insert_next_match` with the remaining atom slice, collects the returned segment tokens, and
finally wraps them into a compound root token. The loop is already implemented inside `ReadCtx`
(the read pipeline) — it needs to be extracted or replicated in the insert path.

---

### RC-2 — `ReadCtx::read_sequence` Returns `None` After Insert

**Location:** `crates/context-read/src/context/mod.rs` (or `read.rs`) — `ReadCtx::read_sequence`

**Mechanism:** After `insert_sequence` writes atoms and a (broken, width=1) token into the graph,
a subsequent call to `ReadCtx::read_sequence` on the same text returns `None`. The API layer
converts this into `ApiError::InternalError("read_sequence returned None for text of length N")`.

The exact interaction is not fully traced, but the hypothesis is that `ReadCtx` builds its atom
index at construction time and the atom/pattern indices written by `insert_sequence` interfere
with the read traversal path (the graph has changed shape since `ReadCtx` was initialised).

**Impact:** 3 direct test failures. May resolve automatically after RC-1 because the graph state
after a *correct* insert will differ significantly from the current broken state.

**Fix:** Re-evaluate after RC-1. If still broken, add a re-initialisation step to `ReadCtx` (or
make atom lookup lazy) so that it sees the current graph state on each call.

---

### RC-3 — Repeated-Character Cursor Advancement

**Location:** `crates/context-read/src/context/` — cursor advancement / `append_to_pattern`
interaction for all-same-character or repeated-pattern inputs.

**Mechanism:** When `read_sequence` (or the future looping `insert_sequence`) encounters a
repeated character (e.g. `"aaaa"`), the cursor advancement logic fails to advance past the first
match. The pattern accumulator gets stuck at position 0 and either:
- Returns width=1 (only the first atom), or
- Panics in the `append_to_pattern` / vertex-mutation path.

This is the pre-existing overlap/cursor bug documented in `20260218_PLAN_CONTEXT_READ_COMPLETION.md`
and partially addressed by `PLAN_APPEND_TO_PATTERN_FIX.md` (the `extend_root_pattern` /
`append_to_owned_pattern` split). The cursor re-use after overlap has not yet been corrected.

**Impact:** 1 direct test failure (`edge_repeated_single_char`) + 2 ignored tests (`oracle_aa`,
`skill3_exp_m_repeated_char_known_failing`). All oracle tests with repeated substrings will also
fail this case once RC-1 is unblocked (though they are currently blocked by RC-1, not RC-3).

**Fix:** Cursor advancement redesign in `context-read` — separate plan.
Blocked until RC-1 is resolved so the outer loop is in place to exercise the cursor logic.

---

## Fix Round 1 — RC-1: `insert_sequence` Outer Loop

### Goal

After this round:
- 5 failing tests turn green (RC-1 failures)
- 20 ignored tests unblock and turn green (`skill3_exp_*` + `oracle_*`)
- `file_read_basic` turns green
- Total score improves from **44/9/22** to **~64/3/2**

### Entry Point

```
crates/context-api/src/workspace/manager.rs
```

Find the method `insert_sequence` (or the equivalent function that:
1. Converts text to atom tokens via `get_or_create_atoms`
2. Calls `insert_next_match` once
3. Returns an `InsertResult` / `CommandResult::InsertResult`

### Change Description

**Current (broken) logic (pseudocode):**

```rust
fn insert_sequence(&mut self, workspace: &str, text: &str) -> Result<CommandResult, ApiError> {
    let ws = self.get_open_workspace_mut(workspace)?;
    let atoms = ws.get_or_create_atoms(text);        // Vec<Token>
    let outcome = ws.insert_next_match(&atoms)?;     // called ONCE
    let token = outcome.into_token();
    Ok(CommandResult::InsertResult(InsertResult {
        token,
        already_existed: !outcome.is_created(),
    }))
}
```

**Desired (fixed) logic (pseudocode):**

```rust
fn insert_sequence(&mut self, workspace: &str, text: &str) -> Result<CommandResult, ApiError> {
    let ws = self.get_open_workspace_mut(workspace)?;
    let atoms: Vec<Token> = ws.get_or_create_atoms(text);

    // Outer accumulation loop — mirrors ReadCtx segment iteration
    let mut cursor = 0usize;
    let mut segments: Vec<Token> = Vec::new();

    while cursor < atoms.len() {
        let remaining = &atoms[cursor..];
        let outcome = ws.insert_next_match(remaining)?;
        let width = outcome.token().width;
        segments.push(outcome.into_token());
        cursor += width;
    }

    // If the full input is a single segment, return it directly.
    // Otherwise wrap the segments into a compound root token.
    let root_token = if segments.len() == 1 {
        segments.remove(0)
    } else {
        ws.insert_or_get_complete_from_parts(&segments)?
    };

    let already_existed = /* based on first outcome */ ...;
    Ok(CommandResult::InsertResult(InsertResult {
        token: root_token,
        already_existed,
    }))
}
```

> **Note:** The exact API names (`insert_next_match`, `into_token`, `insert_or_get_complete_from_parts`)
> may differ from the actual code. The key invariant is: **the loop advances `cursor` by
> `outcome.token().width` after each call and stops when `cursor == atoms.len()`.**

### Investigation Steps

Before writing the fix, answer these questions by reading the source:

1. **Where exactly is `insert_sequence` called in `WorkspaceManager`?**
   - `grep -r "insert_sequence\|InsertSequence" crates/context-api/src/`
   - Note the actual function signature and which workspace method it delegates to.

2. **What does `insert_next_match` return today?**
   - Read `crates/context-insert/src/insert/outcome.rs` for the `InsertOutcome` enum.
   - Confirm: `Created`, `Complete`, `NoExpansion` — what does each carry? What is `.width`?

3. **How does `ReadCtx` implement the outer loop?**
   - Read `crates/context-read/src/context/` — find `SegmentIter` or the equivalent iterator.
   - The fix should replicate exactly this logic in `insert_sequence`.

4. **What wraps segments into a compound root?**
   - Read how `ReadCtx` commits a completed read — is there a `finalize`, `commit`, or
     `insert_root` step? This is the "wrap segments into compound root" step.
   - If no such function exists, it may need to be added to `context-insert`.

5. **How is `already_existed` determined for multi-segment results?**
   - Convention: `already_existed = true` iff ALL segments are `Complete` (nothing new was written).
   - If any segment is `Created`, the overall result is "new content added."

```

test result: ok. 64 passed; 3 failed; 2 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

(3 remaining failures = RC-2; 2 ignored = RC-3)

## Fix Round 2 — RC-2: `read_sequence` After Insert

### Goal

After this round:
- 3 failing tests turn green (RC-2 failures)
- Total score improves from **~64/3/2** to **~67/0/2**

### Precondition

**Must complete Round 1 (RC-1) first.** RC-2 may resolve automatically after RC-1 because the
graph state written by a correct insert differs from the current broken state. Run the three RC-2
tests after Round 1 before investing effort in a separate Round 2 fix:

```sh
cargo test -p context-cli --test cli_integration \
  read_sequence_after_insert \
  dedup_read_sequence_finds_existing \
  dedup_multiple_reads_same_result \
  -- --exact 2>&1
```

If all three pass → Round 2 is already done. Skip to Round 3.

### Entry Point (if still failing after RC-1)

```
crates/context-read/src/context/mod.rs   (or read.rs — wherever read_sequence lives)
```

### Investigation Steps

1. **Reproduce the failure in isolation:**

   ```sh
   cargo test -p context-cli --test cli_integration read_sequence_after_insert \
     -- --exact --nocapture 2>&1
   ```

   Note the exact error: `"read_sequence returned None for text of length N"`.

2. **Trace where `None` is returned:**
   - Find the call site in `context-api` that calls `ReadCtx::read_sequence`.
   - Add a `dbg!` or `eprintln!` before the call to print the graph state (vertex count,
     atom list) to confirm that prior insert has modified the graph.
   - Step into `ReadCtx::read_sequence` and find the first path that returns `None`.

3. **Identify the stale-state interaction:**
   - `ReadCtx` is likely created fresh for each `ReadSequence` command via something like
     `ReadCtx::new(&workspace.graph, chars)`.
   - The graph has been modified by `insert_sequence` since the last `ReadCtx` was created.
   - Hypothesis: `ReadCtx::new` caches atom indices or pattern IDs at construction time;
     these are now stale because new vertices have been added.
   - Alternative hypothesis: the outer loop (after RC-1 fix) advances the cursor but the
     `read_sequence` path has a different cursor logic that breaks on the new graph topology.

4. **Determine the minimal fix:**
   - If the issue is a stale atom cache: make atom lookup lazy (look up the atom index from
     the graph on demand rather than caching at construction time).
   - If the issue is a different cursor logic: align `read_sequence` with the new outer loop
     from Round 1 so both paths share the same cursor advancement contract.

```

## Fix Round 3 — RC-3: Repeated-Character Cursor Advancement

### Goal

After this round:
- 1 failing test turns green (`edge_repeated_single_char`)
- 2 ignored tests turn green (`oracle_aa`, `skill3_exp_m_repeated_char_known_failing`)
- Total score improves from **~67/0/2** to **~70/0/0**

### Precondition

**Must complete Rounds 1 and 2 first.** The outer loop from Round 1 must be in place before
RC-3 can be properly exercised — without the loop, all repeated-pattern inputs fail at the
first iteration for unrelated reasons.

### Background

The `append_to_pattern` split (`PLAN_APPEND_TO_PATTERN_FIX.md`, now complete) addressed the
vertex-corruption risk in `extend_root_pattern` vs. `append_to_owned_pattern`. However, the
cursor advancement for overlap/repeat sequences was not fixed in that plan — it was deferred.

When the outer loop processes `"aaaa"`, the sequence of calls is approximately:

```
insert_next_match([a, a, a, a])   → outcome: NoExpansion, width=1 (atom 'a')
insert_next_match([a, a, a])      → outcome: NoExpansion, width=1 (atom 'a') — cursor: +1
insert_next_match([a, a])         → outcome: NoExpansion, width=1 (atom 'a') — cursor: +1
insert_next_match([a])            → outcome: Complete,    width=1 (atom 'a') — cursor: +1
```

After 4 calls, `cursor = 4 = atoms.len()`. The segments are `[a, a, a, a]`. The compound root
should be `[a, a, a, a]` with width 4.

However, somewhere in this path, the cursor does not advance. The exact bug location is:
- Either in `insert_next_match` itself (returns width=0 or the wrong token), or
- In the overlap/repeat detection in `context-read`'s `SegmentIter` / cursor logic, or
- In the `extend_root_pattern` call that tries to build the compound token from 4 identical
  children, causing an infinite loop or width miscalculation.

### Investigation Steps

1. **Add instrumentation to the outer loop (after Round 1):**

   In the new outer loop in `insert_sequence`, add temporary `eprintln!` calls:

   ```rust
   while cursor < atoms.len() {
       let remaining = &atoms[cursor..];
       eprintln!("RC-3 debug: cursor={cursor}, remaining.len()={}", remaining.len());
       let outcome = ws.insert_next_match(remaining)?;
       eprintln!("RC-3 debug: outcome width={}, kind={:?}", outcome.token().width, outcome.kind());
       // ... advance cursor
   }
   ```

   Run `edge_repeated_single_char` with `--nocapture` and observe where the loop gets stuck.

2. **Check `insert_next_match` for width=0:**
   - If `outcome.token().width == 0`, the loop will loop forever. Add a guard:
     ```rust
     let width = outcome.token().width;
     assert!(width > 0, "insert_next_match returned zero-width token at cursor={cursor}");
     cursor += width;
     ```
   - A panic with this message immediately identifies whether width=0 is the issue.

3. **Check the compound root construction for identical children:**
   - After the loop: `segments = [a, a, a, a]` — four token references to the same atom vertex.
   - `insert_or_get_complete_from_parts([a, a, a, a])` must produce a width-4 compound token.
   - If the compound insertion mutates the atom vertex's width (the `append_to_pattern` bug),
     this is where the width corruption occurs.
   - Verify that `extend_root_pattern` (from `PLAN_APPEND_TO_PATTERN_FIX`) is being used, not
     the deprecated `append_to_pattern`.

4. **Consult `context-read` crate tests:**
   - Run `cargo test -p context-read -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAILED|ok)"` and
     note which tests involve repeated characters.
   - The ~29/60 failing tests in `context-read` include the repeat/overlap cases.
     Fix must not regress these.

5. **Consult `PLAN_CONTEXT_READ_COMPLETION.md`** for the existing analysis of the cursor
   advancement and `append_to_pattern` issues — do not duplicate work already planned there.

## Obs-Test Retirement

The `skill3_obs*` tests in `skill3_exploration.rs` document the **current broken behaviour**
(RC-1 present) to prevent silent regressions. Once RC-1 is fixed, these observations become
false (they assert that `insert_sequence` returns `already_existed=true` and `width=1`).

After Round 1 is complete and green, retire each `obs` test:

| Test | Action |
|------|--------|
| `skill3_obs1_multi_char_insert_reports_already_existed_true_today` | Delete — now incorrect |
| `skill3_obs2_same_text_twice_same_atom_index_today` | Delete — now incorrect |
| `skill3_obs3_atoms_correctly_auto_created_and_deduped` | Keep — still correct |
| `skill3_obs4_cross_word_atom_sharing` | Keep — still correct |
| `skill3_obs5_graph_valid_under_rc1_conditions` | Rename to `skill3_obs5_graph_valid_after_inserts` and keep |

Also remove the `#[ignore = "RC-1: …"]` attributes from all `skill3_exp_*` tests once Round 1
is verified.

**Do this AFTER Round 1 verification passes**, not before — the `obs` tests serve as regression
guards during the Round 1 implementation work.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| RC-2 does **not** resolve after RC-1 | Medium | Medium | Round 2 investigation steps are pre-planned; scope is narrow (3 tests, 1 call site) |
| Outer loop in RC-1 fix introduces infinite loop on repeated-char inputs | High | High | Add `assert!(width > 0)` guard immediately; this will panic instead of hanging |
| `insert_or_get_complete_from_parts` does not exist; compound root wrapping requires new API | Medium | High | Read the `ReadCtx` finalize path carefully before writing Round 1 — reuse existing APIs |
| RC-3 fix causes regressions in the ~29 already-failing `context-read` tests | Medium | Medium | Run `cargo test -p context-read` before and after Round 3; compare failure lists; only proceed if new failures = 0 |
| `skill3_obs*` retirement breaks CI before Round 1 lands | Low | Low | Retire obs tests in the same commit as the Round 1 fix, not before |
| RC-3 requires a large cursor redesign that touches RC-1 loop | Medium | High | If Round 3 requires redesigning the outer loop from Round 1, plan a combined Round 1+3 fix — do not patch twice |
| Oracle tests reveal correctness issues beyond RC-1 | Medium | Medium | Oracle tests are explicit about expected graph structure; failures after RC-1 fix give specific diff output. Treat each oracle failure as a new tracked bug, not a blocker for the remediation plan |

## Notes

### Session Start Checklist

Before beginning any fix round, run:

```sh
# Confirm baseline is unchanged
cargo test -p context-cli --test cli_integration 2>&1 | tail -3
# Expected: FAILED. 44 passed; 9 failed; 22 ignored

# Confirm crate-level tests have no new failures
cargo test -p context-api 2>&1 | tail -3
cargo test -p context-insert 2>&1 | tail -3
cargo test -p context-read 2>&1 | tail -3
```

If the baseline differs from the snapshot above, update this plan before proceeding.
