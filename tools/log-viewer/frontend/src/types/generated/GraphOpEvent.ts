 * Unified event for graph operation visualization.

 * Emitted as a `tracing::info!` event with `message == "graph_op"`.
 * The log-viewer frontend parses the `graph_op` field as JSON.
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * ```ignore
 * let event = GraphOpEvent {
 *     step: 0,
 *     op_type: OperationType::Search,
 *     transition: Transition::StartNode { node: 42 },
 *     location: LocationInfo { selected_node: Some(42), ..Default::default() },
 *     query: QueryInfo { query_tokens: vec![1, 2, 3], cursor_position: 0, query_width: 3 },
 *     description: "Search started at node 42".into(),
 * };
 * event.emit();
 * ```
