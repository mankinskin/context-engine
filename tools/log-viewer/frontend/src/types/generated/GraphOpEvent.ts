 * Unified event for graph operation visualization.

 *
 * ```ignore
 * let event = GraphOpEvent::search(0, "search-42-0", Transition::StartNode { node: 42 }, "Search started at node 42")
 *     .with_location(LocationInfo::selected(42))
 *     .with_query(QueryInfo::new(vec![1, 2, 3], 0, 3));
 * event.emit();
