## Objective

Use `create_workspace_from_ngrams_text` as a **ground-truth oracle** against
which we can validate that `read_sequence` (context-read) produces structurally
correct hypergraphs for the same input strings.

Concretely: for a set of carefully chosen short strings (≤10 characters), run
both algorithms, then assert that every token created by context-read has a
corresponding token in the ngrams graph with the same label, the same width,
and at least one structurally matching child-pattern.

This gives us a **semantic correctness test** that is independent of internal
vertex-index assignment, pattern ordering, and intermediate split choices.

## Context

### Parent Plan

Child of [`20260314_PLAN_CONTEXT_READ_UX_IMPROVEMENT.md`](20260314_PLAN_CONTEXT_READ_UX_IMPROVEMENT.md).

Sits in Phase 3 alongside:

- **3d** (Integration Tests) — tests the CLI/API surface
- **3c** (Dungeon Crawler Skills) — documentation
- **3.1** (this plan) — oracle-based structural validation
- **3.2** (`20260315_PLAN_GRAPH_DIFF_COMMAND.md`) — graph diff CLI command

### Why Compare Against Ngrams?

The ngrams algorithm is an independent, bottom-up implementation of the same
hypergraph-building problem.  It:

- Enumerates **all** n-grams of all lengths for the input text
- Identifies "frequent" substrings (those appearing at ≥2 positions)
- Labels "wrapper" tokens (containing overlapping frequent children)
- Builds a final partition graph with the minimal set of structurally
  necessary vertices

Because it works completely differently from context-read (bottom-up enumeration
vs. top-down greedy streaming), agreement between the two is strong evidence of
correctness.  Divergence points to a bug in one or the other.

### Current Blocking Bugs

| Bug | Effect on This Plan |
|-----|---------------------|
| **RC-1** — `insert_sequence` missing outer loop | `read_sequence` produces empty/partial graphs; oracle tests cannot be run |
| **RC-3** — repeat/overlap cursor bug | Strings with repeated characters (`"aa"`, `"abab"`) panic or produce wrong structure |

All oracle tests are written now (as contracts) but tagged `#[ignore]` until the
blocking bugs are fixed.  See §Execution Steps for the unblocking sequence.

## The Ngrams Algorithm — What It Produces

The `parse_corpus` function in `crates/ngrams/src/graph/mod.rs` runs four
passes:

```
Corpus (single text or multi-text)
    │
    ▼  Containment Pass  O(N³)  — enumerate all ngrams of all lengths
    │  for each (n, position): create vertex for n-gram, link to sub-ngrams
    │
    ▼  Frequency Pass    O(V log V)  — label vertices more frequent than parents
    │  vertex v is "frequent" if count(v) > count(parent(v)) for some parent
    │
    ▼  Wrapper Pass      O(V × E)   — label vertices with overlapping children
    │  vertex v is "wrapper" if its frequent-child cover has any intersections
    │
    ▼  Partitions Pass   O(V)       — build final graph (labelled + leaf vertices)
       output: Hypergraph with atoms + frequent + wrapper tokens
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Input Length | Approx. Distinct Ngrams | Observed Wall Time (unoptimised debug build) |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 5           | 15                     | < 1 s                                        |
| 8           | 36                     | 1–3 s                                        |
| 10          | 55                     | 3–10 s                                       |
| 12          | 78                     | 10–30 s                                      |
| 15          | 120                    | 30–120 s  ← near timeout boundary            |
| 20          | 210                    | > 60 s  — frequently times out               |

> **Safe limit for automated tests: ≤ 10 characters, 30 s timeout.**
> Strings of 11–15 chars may be included as `#[ignore = "slow"]` with 120 s.

### What The Ngrams Graph Contains (Single-Text Input)

For a single text string `S`:

1. **Atoms** — all distinct characters in `S` (always present as leaves)
2. **Frequent tokens** — substrings that appear at ≥ 2 distinct positions within
   `S`.  For `"abcabc"`: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"ab"`, `"bc"`, `"abc"`.
3. **Wrapper tokens** — substrings whose frequent-child cover contains
   overlapping ranges.  For `"abcbcd"`: `"bcbc"` or similar.
4. **The root** — `S` itself is always in the vocabulary (as a root-level ngram)
   and appears in the final graph if it is reachable from labelled children.

> **Key property:** For strings where every character is distinct (e.g.,
> `"abcde"`), almost no substrings are "frequent" (they each appear only once),
> so the ngrams graph may contain **only atoms** as labelled vertices, plus the
> root.  Context-read, by contrast, will build intermediate compound tokens.
> This means the **superset relationship is not guaranteed** — it depends on the
> input.  See §Comparison Strategy for how we handle this.

---

## The Context-Read Algorithm — What It Produces

After RC-1 is fixed, `read_sequence("abcabc")` on an empty graph will:

1. **Atomize** — auto-create atoms `a`, `b`, `c` (or reuse existing ones)
2. **Greedy scan** — call `insert_next_match` in a loop:
   - Cursor 0: match largest known prefix → builds `"abc"` via split+join
   - Cursor 3: match largest known prefix → `"abc"` already exists → `Complete`
3. **Create root** — root token `"abcabc"` with child pattern `["abc", "abc"]`

The resulting graph contains exactly the tokens needed to represent the greedy
decomposition, plus the root.  It is a **minimal** graph: no extra vertices for
substrings that were not part of any greedy match.

### The Structural Relationship

For a single input string `S`:

```
ngrams_graph(S)   ⊇   context_read_graph(S)   (by label, for most inputs)
```

**This superset relationship holds when:** The greedy algorithm chooses
decompositions that correspond to tokens present in the ngrams graph.  Since
both algorithms operate on the same string, any token created by context-read
is also a valid substring of S, and if it appears at ≥2 positions in S it will
be in the ngrams graph.

**This superset relationship may NOT hold when:** Context-read creates an
intermediate token that appears only once in S (because it was the result of
the split+join pipeline's internal merge steps) and that token was therefore not
labelled by the frequency pass.

### Correct Validation Framing

We do **not** assert `context_read ⊆ ngrams`.  Instead, for each token in the
context-read graph, we assert:

> *"Either this token also exists in the ngrams graph with matching width and
> a common child pattern, OR it is a valid single-position merge whose children
> are all present in the ngrams graph."*

More practically:

1. **Root token check**: the root label (= the full input string) must be
   reachable in the ngrams graph.
2. **Width check**: every token in context-read has width equal to `len(label)`.
   If the labels agree and the widths agree, the vertex is correct.
3. **Child pattern check**: for every token T in context-read with child
   pattern `[c1, c2, …, ck]`, verify that `label(c1) + label(c2) + … + label(ck)
   == label(T)`.  This is the **concatenation invariant** — independent of the
   ngrams graph.
4. **Ngrams cross-check**: for every non-atom token T in context-read, check
   whether a token with the same label exists in the ngrams graph.  Tokens that
   are absent from ngrams are flagged as "unverified by oracle" (not necessarily
   wrong, but suspicious).

---

## Comparison Strategy

### Label-Indexed Graph Representation

Both graphs are normalised into a `LabelMap`:

```rust
/// Canonical, label-indexed view of a hypergraph for comparison purposes.
pub struct LabelMap {
    /// label → (width, Vec<Vec<label>>)  — set of child patterns, each pattern
    /// as a sequence of child labels.
    pub tokens: HashMap<String, TokenEntry>,
    /// Labels of atom vertices (width == 1).
    pub atoms: HashSet<String>,
}

pub struct TokenEntry {
    pub width: usize,
    /// Each inner Vec is one child pattern; order within a pattern is preserved;
    /// patterns themselves are stored as a sorted set to allow order-insensitive
    /// comparison.
    pub patterns: BTreeSet<Vec<String>>,
}
```

**Building a `LabelMap` from a workspace:**

1. Call `Command::GetSnapshot` to obtain a `GraphSnapshot` (nodes + edges).
2. Build `HashMap<usize, String>` (index → label) from `SnapshotNode` list.
3. For each parent node, collect its edges sorted by `(pattern_idx, sub_index)`,
   group by `pattern_idx`, resolve child indices to labels, store as
   `Vec<Vec<label>>`.
4. Insert atoms (width == 1) into the `atoms` set.

### Comparison Checks (ordered by severity)

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Root present** | Fatal | The full input string must exist in both graphs |
| **Width agreement** | Fatal | For each shared label, `width_A == width_B` |
| **Concatenation invariant** | Fatal | For each pattern in B: concatenation of child labels == parent label |
| **Atoms agree** | Error | `atoms_A == atoms_B` (same distinct characters) |
| **Pattern subsumption** | Warning | For each pattern in B, at least one pattern in A has the same child-label sequence |
| **Extra vertices in B** | Info | Labels in context-read not present in ngrams graph |

"Fatal" checks cause the test to fail immediately.  "Error" also fails.
"Warning" and "Info" are logged but do not fail the test — they capture the
known mismatch between minimal (context-read) and complete (ngrams) graphs.

### Design Decision D17: Label-Indexed Comparison

Vertex indices are internal implementation details assigned in insertion order.
The same logical token will have different numeric indices in the ngrams and
context-read graphs.  Therefore all comparison is done by **string label**,
which is uniquely determined by the token's character content.

### Design Decision D18: Pattern Comparison Is Order-Insensitive Across Patterns, Order-Sensitive Within

Within a single child pattern (a sequence of tokens), **order is semantically
significant** — `["ab", "c"]` and `["c", "ab"]` represent different
decompositions of `"abc"`.  However, the **set of patterns** a token has is
unordered — both `["ab", "c"]` and `["a", "bc"]` are valid patterns for `"abc"`.

Therefore: pattern comparison sorts the outer Vec (set of patterns) but
preserves the inner Vec (sequence within each pattern).

### Design Decision D19: Oracle Tests Are `#[ignore]` Until RC-1 Is Fixed

Context-read produces empty graphs today (RC-1).  Writing the tests now as
`#[ignore]` serves two purposes:
1. The test bodies document the **contract** the fixed algorithm must satisfy.
2. Unignoring a batch of tests when RC-1 is fixed gives instant pass/fail
   signal on the fix quality.

### Design Decision D20: Snapshots Are Taken After Graph Is Stable

Comparison is snapshot-based.  We call `Command::GetSnapshot` after the graph
operation completes and the workspace is closed/saved.  No locks are held
during comparison.  This avoids the need for cross-workspace locking.

## Input String Selection

### Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Length ≤ 10 chars | Ngrams completes in < 10 s on debug build |
| At least one repeated character or repeated n-gram | Otherwise ngrams labels only atoms (no shared structure to compare) |
| Covers overlap scenarios | Tests the BandState / wrapper path in both algorithms |
| Covers the degenerate case | All-same chars, all-distinct chars — boundary conditions |

### Chosen Test Inputs

| String | Length | Why Interesting | Ngrams Labels (expected) |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| `"abab"` | 4 | Repeated bigram | `a`, `b`, `ab` |
| `"abcabc"` | 6 | Repeated trigram | `a`, `b`, `c`, `ab`, `bc`, `abc` |
| `"abcbcd"` | 6 | Adjacent overlap: "abc" & "bcd" share "bc" | `b`, `c`, `bc`, `abc` (freq), `bcd` (freq) |
| `"aabbaabb"` | 8 | Nested repetition | `a`, `b`, `aa`, `bb`, `aabb` |
| `"ababab"` | 6 | Longer repetition | `a`, `b`, `ab`, `aba`, `bab` |
| `"abcab"` | 5 | Partial overlap at end | `a`, `b`, `ab`, `abc` |
| `"aa"` | 2 | All-same — RC-3 boundary | `a` |
| `"ab"` | 2 | Minimum non-atom | `a`, `b` |
| `"aabaa"` | 5 | Complex repetition | `a`, `b`, `aa`, `aab`, `baa` |
| `"abcdabc"` | 7 | Prefix repeat | `a`, `b`, `c`, `ab`, `bc`, `abc` |

> The `"aa"` case is marked `#[ignore = "RC-3"]` separately from the RC-1 block
> since it exercises the repeat/overlap bug independently.

### Slow-Track Inputs (tagged `#[ignore = "slow"]`, length 11–15)

| String | Length | Why Interesting |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| `"abcabcabc"` | 9 | Triple repetition of "abc" |
| `"abababab"` | 8 | Long binary repetition |
| `"ottosmops"` | 9 | From OTTOS_MOPS_CORPUS — realistic |

### `integration/ngrams_oracle_tests.rs` — Test Structure

```rust
//! Ngrams oracle validation tests.
//!
//! For each test string, we:
//!   1. Create workspace "oracle-<string>" via create_workspace_from_ngrams_text.
//!   2. Create workspace "read-<string>" via read_sequence (after atoms are set up).
//!   3. Extract GraphSnapshot from both.
//!   4. Build LabelMaps.
//!   5. Run compare_against_oracle.
//!   6. Assert report_is_ok.

// Helper macro to reduce boilerplate
macro_rules! oracle_test {
    ($test_name:ident, $string:expr, $timeout:expr) => {

        fn $test_name() {

### `TestWorkspace` Extension — `new_pair`

Add `new_pair` to the existing `TestWorkspace` in `common/helpers.rs`:

```rust
/// Creates both an oracle workspace (ngrams) and a candidate workspace
/// (read_sequence) for the same input string.
pub struct WorkspacePair {
    mgr: TestWorkspace,     // single manager hosting both workspaces
    oracle_name: String,    // "<input>-oracle"
    candidate_name: String, // "<input>-read"
}

impl WorkspacePair {
    pub fn new(input: &str, ngrams_timeout_secs: u64) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn oracle_snapshot(&mut self) -> GraphSnapshot { ... }
    pub fn candidate_snapshot(&mut self) -> GraphSnapshot { ... }
}
```

## Files Affected

### New Files

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tools/context-cli/tests/common/graph_compare.rs` | LabelMap, comparison logic, ComparisonReport |
| `tools/context-cli/tests/integration/ngrams_oracle_tests.rs` | Oracle test cases (~15 tests) |

### Modified Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `tools/context-cli/tests/common/mod.rs` | Add `pub mod graph_compare;` |
| `tools/context-cli/tests/integration/mod.rs` | Add `mod ngrams_oracle_tests;` |

### No New API Commands

The comparison logic is implemented entirely in test helpers using the existing
`Command::GetSnapshot` command.  No changes to `context-api`, `context-cli`
source, or `context-read` are required.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Implement `common/graph_compare.rs`

Write the `LabelMap`, `TokenEntry`, `ComparisonReport`, `label_map_from_snapshot`,
and `compare_against_oracle` functions.

**Entry criteria:** `tools/context-cli` compiles cleanly.
**Exit criteria:** Module compiles, unit tests for `label_map_from_snapshot` pass
on a hand-crafted `GraphSnapshot`.

### Step 2: Extend `TestWorkspace` with `WorkspacePair`

Add `WorkspacePair::new`, `oracle_snapshot`, `candidate_snapshot` to
`common/helpers.rs`.

**Entry criteria:** Step 1 done.
**Exit criteria:** `WorkspacePair` compiles; can call `oracle_snapshot()` without panicking.

### Step 3: Write `integration/ngrams_oracle_tests.rs`

Write the 15 oracle tests using the macro, all tagged `#[ignore = "RC-1:…"]`
or `#[ignore = "RC-3:…"]`.

**Entry criteria:** Step 2 done.
**Exit criteria:** `cargo test -p context-cli --test cli_integration -- oracle`
shows all 15 tests as `ignored` (no compilation errors, no unexpected failures).

### Step 4: Register Modules

Update `common/mod.rs` and `integration/mod.rs`.

**Entry criteria:** Step 3 done.
**Exit criteria:** Full test suite runs: `cargo test -p context-cli --test cli_integration`
shows the expected pass/fail/ignored counts from `FAILING_TESTS.md`.

### Step 5 (Deferred — after RC-1 fix): Unignore and Validate

After `insert_sequence` outer loop is implemented:

1. Remove `#[ignore = "RC-1:…"]` from oracle tests.
2. Run `cargo test -p context-cli --test cli_integration -- oracle`.
3. Fix any test failures that represent genuine algorithm bugs.
4. Update `FAILING_TESTS.md` with new status.

**Expected outcome:** All oracle tests for non-repeated strings pass.
`oracle_aa` remains ignored until RC-3 is fixed.

### Step 6 (Deferred — after RC-3 fix): Unignore Repeat Tests

Remove `#[ignore = "RC-3:…"]` from `oracle_aa` (and any other RC-3 affected
tests added in the meantime).

---

## Validation

### Correctness Criteria

| Criterion | How Verified |
|-----------|--------------|
| `LabelMap` correctly parses snapshot | Unit tests with hand-crafted `GraphSnapshot` |
| Concatenation invariant check catches real bugs | Test with a deliberately wrong `GraphSnapshot` |
| Oracle test correctly identifies a bad context-read graph | Negative test: inject a bogus token into the candidate and assert `!report_is_ok` |
| All oracle tests `ignored` before RC-1 fix | `cargo test -- oracle` shows 0 failures, 15 ignored |
| All oracle tests pass after RC-1 fix | `cargo test -- oracle` shows 14+ passing (oracle_aa still ignored) |

### CLI Smoke Test (Manual, Post-Fix)

```bash
# Build a debug binary
cargo build -p context-cli

# Create ngrams workspace for "abcabc" (should take < 5 s)
context-cli create-ngrams ngrams-abcabc --timeout 30 abcabc

# Create read workspace for "abcabc"
context-cli create read-abcabc
context-cli read-sequence read-abcabc abcabc

# Inspect both (no compare command yet — that's Phase 3.2)
context-cli show --workspace ngrams-abcabc
context-cli show --workspace read-abcabc

# Expected: both graphs contain vertices labelled "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc",
# "abc", "abcabc" with consistent widths and child patterns.
```

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Ngrams times out on test machine | Medium | Test is skipped, not failed | Default timeout 30 s; all oracle tests already tagged `#[ignore]` until RC-1 lands, so a timeout is treated as a non-blocking skip |
| Ngrams labels fewer tokens than expected for all-distinct strings | High | Oracle cross-check produces many "unverified by oracle" warnings | Downgrade "absent from oracle" to `Info` severity; add a note in test output |
| Concatenation invariant catches false positives | Low | Tests fail spuriously | Verify invariant logic against hand-crafted cases before running against live graphs |
| RC-1 fix changes graph structure in an unexpected way | Medium | Several oracle tests may reveal new bugs | Each failure must be triaged: genuine algorithm bug vs. oracle expectation mismatch |
| `GetSnapshot` label field contains truncated text (RC-1 symptom) | High | LabelMap will contain wrong labels | Graph compare is only run after RC-1 is fixed; label correctness is a precondition |

## Notes

### Questions for User

- Should oracle tests run in CI (taking up to 30 s each) or only on demand?
  Suggested: run on demand via `cargo test -- oracle` filter; exclude from
  default `cargo test` using a feature flag or `#[ignore]`.
- Is there a preferred upper bound on ngrams timeout for CI environments?
  Default of 30 s suggested here; 10 s may be more appropriate for CI.
- Should the `ComparisonReport` be emitted as a structured log event (for
  the log viewer) or just printed to stderr?
